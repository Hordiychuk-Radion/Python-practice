# Python practice with pandas,numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.


#**Data Understanding**

-*Imported data.*

-*Opened the data.*

-*First checked our data.*

[s1 data understanding.ipynb](s1%20data%20understanding.ipynb)

**Data Preparation**

-*Filtered columns by need.*

-*Converted dtype of certain columns.*

-*Renamed columns.*

-*Used value counts to determine duplicates and unique values in features.*

-*Located duplicated rows in single or multiple columns.*

-*Dropped duplicated rows from dataset and reset index.*

**Feature Understanding**

-*Univariate analysis of features: KDE, histogram, box plot.*

-*Created bar plot for top 10 years with the highest number of coasters introduced.*

-*Created histogram to bin speeds of roller coasters and view their frequency distribution.*

 [s3 Feature Understanding.ipynb](s3%20Feature%20Understanding.ipynb)

**Feature Relationships**

-*Created scatterplot for speed and height with year-based hue of points.*

-*Created pairplot to compare correlations between features, alongside hue from material type.*

-*Created a correlation heatmap for selected features.*

[s4 Feature relationships.ipynb](s4%20Feature%20relationships.ipynb)

**Ask Questions**

-*Used groupby and query to create a bar plot with sorted descending data on mean speed of roller coasters by location.*
