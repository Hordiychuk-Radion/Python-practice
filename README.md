# Python practice with pandas,numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.


**Data Understanding**

-*Imported data.*

-*Opened the data.*

-*First checked our data.*


**Data Preparation**

-*Filtered columns by need.*
-*Converted dtype of certain columns.*
-*Renamed columns.*
-*Used value counts to determine duplicates and unique values in features.*
-*Located duplicated rows in single or multiple columns.*
-*Dropped duplicated rows from dataset and reset index.*

**Feature Understanding**

-*Univariate analysis of features: KDE, histogram, box plot.*
-*Created bar plot for top 10 years with the highest number of coasters introduced.*
-*Created histogram to bin speeds of roller coasters and view their frequency distribution.*

**Feature Relationships**

-*Created scatterplot for speed and height with year-based hue of points.*
-*Created pairplot to compare correlations between features, alongside hue from material type.*
-*Created a correlation heatmap for selected features.*

**Ask Questions**

-*Used groupby and query to create a bar plot with sorted descending data on mean speed of roller coasters by location.*
